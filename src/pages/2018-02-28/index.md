<p><b>Price: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free</span></p>
<h4><b>15. ECMA-262 by Dmitry Soshnikov</b></h4>

<p><b>Price: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free</span></p>
<h4><b>22. Backbone Fundamentals</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frameworks, frameworks.

It’s written by Addy Osmani, the same guy responsible for the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning JavaScript Design Patterns</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> book that’s listed above. As with the other framework resources, beginners need not apply.</span></p>

<h4><b>25. Scotch.io</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If and when you start working with JavaScript frameworks like Angular.js or Ember.js, you can </span><a href="https://scotch.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">head to Scotch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for some great tips and tricks. As an aside, there are plenty of resources for other languages too so it’s a great place to bookmark. Due to the nature of JavaScript frameworks, this one is recommended for intermediate to experienced coders only.</span></p>
<p><b>Price: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free</span></p>
<h4><b>26. Tuts+ JavaScript Tutorials</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuts+ actually has a couple good places where you can find JavaScript lessons.

<p><b>Price: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free</span></p>

It’s designed to help JavaScript library users into full-blown developers, so it uses a lot of advanced concepts and details. It is well elaborated and easy to follow, so if you have previous experience you should feel right at home. Keep in mind, it was written back when JavaScript 1.5 was being heavily used. It’s still a great resource, however. There are also two other guides to acquire more knowledge from: </span><a href="http://jqueryenlightenment.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">JQuery Enlightenment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://domenlightenment.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DOM Enlightenment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

You can try your hand at the difficult quiz to test your JavaScript knowledge. If you’d rather not, you can take a look at the many posts that offers tips, tricks and tutorials for working with the language. The only downside is that it’s updated rather infrequently by the owner, Juriy Zaytsev, who used to be a core developer of Prototype.js and also created Fabric.js.
