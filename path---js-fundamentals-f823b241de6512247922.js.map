It’s actually a depository with finished code, but the idea behind it is that you learn JavaScript by spotting and fixing errors. It’s great for anyone who prefers to learn by experience, but you’ll definitely need a bit of previous experience for this one. If you want to set up the tutorial, you’ll need to register for a GitHub account.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Price: Free; expanded accounts start at $7/month</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"20\\\">\\n<li>HTML Dog JavaScript Tutorials\\nHTML Dog’s JavaScript Tutorial runs the entire gamut of the language, starting with beginner concepts and ending with more advanced stuff like working with local storage, errors and exceptions, different frameworks and more.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Price: Free</p>\\n<ol start=\\\"21\\\">\\n<li>A Better Way to Learn AngularJS\\nThis is for intermediate to experienced JavaScript developers.

If you don’t have any prior coding experience it’s an incredibly valuable resource. You’ll learn how to work with a variety of languages including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, JQuery and much more.
